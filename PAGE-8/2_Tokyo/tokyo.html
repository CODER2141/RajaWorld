        <h2>Show Information About Tokyo</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            Tokyo is undeniably the most polarizing character in the show Money Heist (or La Casa de Papel). Some fans see her as an unnecessary character who causes too much trouble for the gang, while others admire her for her fearlessness and unpredictabilityWhatever viewers think of her, she’s undoubtedly left her mark on the show through her actions and unforgettable lines. Some of these quotes speak volumes about her character, with the best ones showing how much she has transformed from being a selfish mess into a brave and loyal member of the crew.This quote from the third episode of part 3 perfectly sums up Tokyo’s personality on Money Heist. She could have been a more valuable and rational leader if she didn’t let her emotions rule her so often.

            Unfortunately, love always seems to complicate things during a heist. This is evident in Stockholm and Denver’s rocky relationship, as well as the Professor and Lisbon’s complicated partnership. The most obvious example, of course, is Tokyo and Rio’s chaotic romance. They’ve put themselves and the entire gang in danger more than once, even causing Rio’s kidnapping through a poorly timed phone call. For Tokyo, however, it’s all worth it in the name of love.
